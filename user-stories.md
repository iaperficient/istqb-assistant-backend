## Story 3: Knowledge Base Integration

**Persona:** Alex, a QA Professional  
**Story Statement:** As a user asking about ISTQB topics, I want the chatbot to provide accurate answers based on a knowledge base so that I get relevant and consistent information.

**Benefit:** Provides contextual responses by retrieving relevant information from a predefined knowledge base before generating AI responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System searches knowledge base for relevant content based on user query
- Retrieved context is included in the AI prompt
- Chatbot responses reference knowledge base information when available
- System gracefully handles queries with no matching knowledge base entries
- Knowledge base covers common ISTQB FAQ topics

**Mapped Endpoints:**
- `POST /chat` - Enhanced with knowledge retrieval logic

## Story 4: Health Check and Monitoring

**Persona:** DevOps Engineer  
**Story Statement:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor the health of the chatbot service so that I can ensure it's running properly in production.

**Benefit:** Enables monitoring and quick detection of service issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Health check endpoint returns service status
- Endpoint checks database connectivity and external API availability
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Includes basic service information in response
- Does not require authentication

**Mapped Endpoints:**

## Story 5: Error Handling and Rate Limiting

**Persona:** Alex, a QA Professional  
**Story Statement:** As a user of the chatbot, I want to receive clear error messages and fair usage limits so that I understand any issues and can use the service appropriately.

**Benefit:** Provides a stable and fair service experience for all users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API rate limiting prevents abuse
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Graceful handling of external API failures (LLM service)

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Core Components
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with register/login endpoints
- **Chat API**: Protected endpoint that integrates with LLM service
- **Knowledge Base**: JSON/YAML file with ISTQB FAQs for context retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and rate limiting

### Knowledge Base Structure
```json
{
  "faqs": [
    {
      "topic": "Foundation Level",
      "question": "What is ISTQB Foundation Level?",
      "answer": "The Foundation Level is the entry-level certification..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in via `/users/register` or `/users/login`
2. Server returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in Authorization header for `/chat` requests
4. Middleware validates token before processing chat requests

### Chat Flow
1. User sends message to `/chat` with valid auth token
2. System searches knowledge base for relevant context
3. Context + user message sent to LLM API
4. AI response returned to user

### Deployment Requirements
- Environment variables for API keys and configuration
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Cloud deployment (K8s manifests or serverless)
